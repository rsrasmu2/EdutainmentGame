- "battle arena": opponent, player, math question in the middle, text box to answer question, time limit bar
- grade = score, as you correctly answer your opponents grade goes down until they have a 0
- in battles, player can choose what type of math they are solving in a menu at bottom (+, -, *, /)
--- the game gives them time to prepare when they change math type (3, 2, 1...)
- overworld... player movement, beating back of class kids to front of class (smarter)
-- kids at desks are the ones that will fight you
- random characters in overworld with dialogue on edges of class 
- start with 50/100 health (F), each fight levels you up one grade and gives you more health
- missing an easy question hurts less than missing a difficult one, but difficult correct answers do more damage
- final boss is teacher: teacher chooses what type of math you must do (you go into this fight with an A)
